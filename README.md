Input files and correct solutions to the problems on adventofcode.com
Accepting of all pull requests, after I confirm them with my own code, or you provide proof that the answers are correct.
The structure of this repository should conform to these rules:
```
day01
...
day25
```
Within each folder:
```
day01:
  {name}.input
  {name}.output
  {another name}.input
  {another name}.output
```
  You may replace {name} with anything you want, so long as your input and output files use the same name
The structure of output files:
{answer to first part}
{answer to second part}

Example:

example-day1.input:
```
()())
```
example-day1.output:
```
-1
5
```
